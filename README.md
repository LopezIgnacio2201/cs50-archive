<!-- START BLOCK OF DESCRIPTION -->

<p align="center">Welcome to CS50 Archive, a repository that contains problem sets, and sections summaries of Harvard's CS50 course. The purpose of this repository is to document the practices, labs, exercises, and projects I have completed as part of the Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course and showcase my knowledge in computer science. By uploading this project to GitHub, I can also practice version control, gain basic GIT knowledge, and collaborate with others.
</p>

<p align="center">Currently, all the exercises and projects in this repository are done in C, but I plan to include Python projects as well later in the course. </p>

<p align="center"> Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback if you have any! </p>

  <em>As of April 20, 2023, I started to better document and comment my projects to keep a better track of my progression. Projects prior to this date may seem less professional and poorly (if at all) documented and commented.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Documentation for each project will include the following:</em>
</p>

<ul align="center">
  <li>Date of project creation</li>
  <li>What the project does</li>
  <li>Comments made before starting to write the code used to create the structure of the code itself.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">
  <em>Please note that while I aim to include all of these points in my documentation, some projects may be missing certain details. Thank you for your understanding.</em>
