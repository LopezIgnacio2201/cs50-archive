> This repository contains all the practices, labs, exercises, and projects I have completed as part of the Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. The course covers a wide range of topics, including C programming language, algorithms, data structures, and more.
>
> The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and showcase my knowledge in computer science. And, by uploading this project to GitHub, I can also practice version control, basic GIT knowledge and collaborate with others.
>
> Currently, all the exercises and projects in this repository are done in C, but I plan to include Python projects as well later in the course.
>
> Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback if you have any. Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository!
