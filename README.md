<p align="center">Welcome to CS50 Archive, a repository that contains problem sets, and sections summaries of Harvard's CS50 course. The purpose of this repository is to document the practices, labs, exercises, and projects I have completed as part of the Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course and showcase my knowledge in computer science. By uploading this project to GitHub, I can also practice version control, gain basic GIT knowledge, and collaborate with others.
</p>
<p align="center">Currently, all the exercises and projects in this repository are done in C, but I plan to include Python projects as well later in the course. </p>
<p align="center"> Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback if you have any! </p>

### Tasks yet to be implemented

- [ ] Upload files and projects made in Python, CSS, HTML, JS.
- [ ] Organize better folders and files inside the project following guidelines and common practices   

### Tasks implemented! 😄 ✓

- [x] Better readme.md file!
- [x] Properly use of commits!
- [x] Properly configuration of the repository!

<h4 align="center">Obsidian was used as an archive to document all of the information and tools learned throught the course, this archive is yet to be completed and will probably be uploaded as a different project on a different repository.

  <em>As of April 20, 2023, I started to better document and comment my projects to keep a better track of my progression. Projects prior to this date may seem less professional and poorly (if at all) documented and commented.</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Documentation for each project will include the following:</em>
</p>

<ul align="center">
  <li>Date of project creation</li>
  <li>What the project does</li>
  <li>Comments made before starting to write the code used to create the structure of the code itself.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">
  <em>Please note that while I aim to include all of these points in my documentation, some projects may be missing certain details. Thank you for your understanding.</em>
