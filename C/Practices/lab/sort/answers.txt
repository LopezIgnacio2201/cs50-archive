sort1 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: First test, with sorted number takes about 0,1s, while random and reversed
takes about 3 to 4 seconds, the only program between the three that takes so much
and knowing how selection sort is most likely this is the algorithm its using.

sort2 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: It takes much less time on a short and mostly ordered list than merge sort,
which is one of the advantages of bubble sort over merge sort. 

sort3 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: It takes roughly the same amount of time on the large lists
whether sorted random or reversed, which makes sense since the alogirithm always 
takes the same amount of steps, dividing and then merging, without caring about if they
started being ordered or not.
